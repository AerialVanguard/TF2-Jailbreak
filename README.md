TF2-Jailbreak [TF2Jail]
=============

TF2Jail is a plugin set to allow certain useful features to server operators who are looking to run a Team Fortress 2 Jailbreak server. The plugin offers useful natives for other plugins to useful, a laundry list of console variables to edit and more.

You can find more information about what it can do in full detail in the wiki for this repository. The license is the same as Sourcemod's license so anyone can fork this plugin, edit it, etc but I would like to politely ask that you keep my name on it and the link to this repository. Official licensing is inside the main source code file. (TF2Jail.sp)
