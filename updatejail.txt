Update Notes:

Jailbreak-
* Added a 0.1 timer to strip ammo after players spawn, easier to use than adding compatibility for tNoUnlocksPls plugin set.

++ 08/29/2013

Jailbreak-
* Fixed BecomeWarden not checking if client is valid.
* Timers should now be killed properly. 'sm_pardon' should now work as intended.
* Freeday system has been fleshed out a bit so it properly removes and grants freedays when needed.
* RemoveWarden has been moved from End Round to Round Start.
* Fixed all commands to check if the client is console.
* Added 'sm_jail_deadmute' which is original functionality from 'sm_jail_redmute' split for server operators.

* Added a translation for red mute disabled.

Bluebans-

Jailbreak-
* Updated all menus to use switch statements instead of if/else statements.
* Fixed a bug where trails would stick to players through rounds if they were Freeday.
* Fixed the required check that client must be alive to receive LR.
