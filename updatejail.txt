Update Notes:

++ 09/08/2013

Jailbreak-
* Added a 0.1 timer to strip ammo after players spawn, easier to use than adding compatibility for tNoUnlocksPls plugin set.
* Fixed an error in translations. (lr robotic takeover translation having 2 english translations instead of 1 english and 1 spanish)
* Added a check if the timer handle isn't invalid for Freekillers marked during Player Death.
* Moved some code to the auto balancer to remove the model regardless if Warden is switched over.
* Added a new cvar which allows server operators to change the type of crits given.
* Added a new cvar which allows server operators to set random wardens given on round start.
* Code has been tightened for the advertisement functions so it should disable when needed.
* Reformatted top part of the plugin.
* Fixed the cvar and added a global integer so server operators can set a maximum number of allowed wardens fired by the 'sm_fire' command per map.
* Warden model should now be removed entirely if team is changed with the model. Warden being locked on round end and unlocked on arena round start.
* Added AutoExecConfig include by Impact123. This should automatically update the config when new versions are available.
* Added 'FCVAR_DONTRECORD' to the version cvar.
* Added an SDKHook function to track 'fun_respawnroom' entity zones and remove freedays if they step into those zones.
* Fixed a bug where the plugin would remove freedays would get removed if they step into their own respawn rooms instead of the other teams respawn room.
* Fixed a precache bug for the sound 'ui/system_message_alert.wav' which I assumed was already precached by default.
* Added a limit of 3 clients maximum for the 'freedays for clients' LR which allows the client to choose other clients for freedays. Will add a cvar later to change the amount.
* Translated LR names on the menus, will be adding the rest later.
* Split the source code into sections using ~ lines commented.
* Removed the 'sm_jailbreak' functionality, will be adding in a sub module for it soon.

Bluebans-
* Added a new cvar to replace a define to switch between MySQL support or Array support.
